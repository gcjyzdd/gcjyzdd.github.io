# Sensors

## Radar

Radar uses radio wave. It can measure vehicle speed directly by Doppler effect.

It can also be used for localization by generating radar maps of the environment. Because radar waves bounce off hard surfaces, they can provide measurements to objects without direct line of flight. Radar is the least affected sensor to rain and fog among all sensors on a vehicle.

Radar usually discard static object because of noise of high reflection objects, like cans.


## Lidar

LIDAR: LIght Detection And Ranging, just as RADAR stands for RAdio detection And Ranging. 

Lidar uses infrared laser beam to determine the distance between the sensor and a nearby object. Most current LIDARs use light in the 900nm wavelength range, although some LIDARs use longer wavelengths, which performs better in rain and fog.
